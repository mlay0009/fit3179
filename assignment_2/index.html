    <h2>Education in Australia</h2>
    <div class="column-1-text">
      <p>In Australia, primary education is offered through a range of educational sectors, each with its unique characteristics and 
        contributions to the country's educational landscape. One of the fundamental sectors is the government school system. 
        Government schools are publicly funded and operated by state and territory governments. They serve as an essential pillar of the Australian 
        education system, providing primary education to students in their local communities. These schools are known for their commitment to accessibility, 
        striving to offer quality education to all students, regardless of their socio-economic background. The curriculum and operations of government schools 
        are overseen by the respective state or territory education departments, ensuring alignment with educational standards and goals.</p>
      <p>Another significant sector in Australian primary education is the independent school system. Independent schools are privately funded 
        and managed institutions that operate independently of government control. They enjoy a degree of autonomy in shaping their curriculum, 
        teaching methods, and educational programs. This autonomy allows them to cater to specific educational philosophies and approaches. Independent 
        primary schools can vary widely, with some being associated with particular religious or cultural groups, while others maintain a secular stance. 
        This diversity provides parents and students with a broad array of educational options, allowing them to choose schools that best align with their 
        educational values and goals.</p>
      <p>The third major sector in Australian primary education is Catholic schools. These schools are integral to the Catholic education system in the country. 
        They are operated by the Catholic Church and are characterized by their emphasis on Catholic values and teachings. Catholic schools provide primary 
        education with a focus on moral and spiritual development alongside academic excellence. They often foster a strong sense of community, and students 
        in Catholic schools benefit from a holistic education that integrates faith into their learning experience. Catholic schools, like government and 
        independent schools, contribute significantly to the diversity and richness of primary education in Australia. Families have the freedom to choose 
        the sector that aligns with their values, beliefs, and educational aspirations, making the Australian education system inclusive and varied.</p>

      <h2>Acceptance Rate</h2>
      <div id="line"></div>
      <p>The attendance rate shows how often full-time students in grades 1 to 10 come to school during the first semester. 
        It is calculated as a percentage by comparing the days students actually attend to the total possible school days. 
        These numbers match the National Report on Schooling and the My School website.</p>
      <p>In 2018, NSW government schools established national guidelines for reporting student attendance statistics. 
        Due to the inclusion of part-day absences and accounting for student mobility in the calculation, most schools' attendance 
        rates fell. As a result, data from 2018 onwards could not be compared with previous years.</p>
      <p>In the year <b>2020</b>, data on student attendance during Semester 1 showed a significant decline. 
        This downfall can be attributed to the unprecedented circumstances brought about by the global pandemic, <a href = "https://education.nsw.gov.au/about-us/education-data-and-research/cese/publications/statistics/effects-of-covid-19-on-attendance-2020">COVID-19</a>. 
        During this time, educational institutions across the globe were faced with the challenge of adapting to a new way of teaching and
          learning, which, in many instances, included remote and online education.</p>
