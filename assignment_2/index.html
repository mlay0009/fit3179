      <h2 style="text-align: left;">Education in Sydney</h2>
      <p>The <strong style = "color: #994d00;">Sydney</strong> primary school education system consists of three main categorical sector types which are 
        <strong style = "color: #994d00;">Government, Independent, and Catholic</strong>. Government schools receive public fundings from the <a href = "https://education.nsw.gov.au/">NSW Department 
        of Education</a>, prioritising quality education to all students. These schools are known for their dedication in accessibility, ensuring alignment with
        educational standards, regardless of student socioeconomic status. </p>
      <p>Independent type shcools operate independently of government control, allowing to create own curriculum and teaching methods. Most Independent
        Schools are associated with religious or cultural groups, offering <strong style = "color: #994d00;">diverse educational opportunities</strong>. 
        Catholic schools, which emphasize moral and spiritual development in addition to academics, are the final major sector in Australian primary education. 
        Students in Catholic schools benefit from a holistic education that incorporates faith into their learning experience, and they frequently foster a 
        strong feeling of community.</p>
      <p>As observed from the analysed data, majority of primary schools in Sydney are government-run and are <strong style = "color: #994d00;">evenly 
        located throughout the city</strong>. On the other hand, most Independent schools tend to have higher diversity, shown by the size of each circles. </p>

      <h2 style="text-align: left;">Students Attendance Rate</h2>
      <p>In 2018, NSW government schools established national guidelines for reporting student attendance statistics. 
        Due to the inclusion of part-day absences and accounting for student mobility in the calculation, most schools' attendance 
        rates fell. As a result, data from 2018 onwards could not be compared with previous years.</p>
      <p>In the year <strong style = "color: #994d00;">2020</strong>, data on student attendance during Semester 1 showed a significant decline. 
        This downfall can be attributed to the unprecedented circumstances brought about by the global pandemic, <a href = "https://education.nsw.gov.au/about-us/education-data-and-research/cese/publications/statistics/effects-of-covid-19-on-attendance-2020">COVID-19</a>. 
        During this time, educational institutions across the globe were faced with the challenge of adapting to a new way of teaching and
          learning, which, in many instances, included remote and online education.</p>

      <p>In Australian primary schools, the ICSEA score, which stands for the Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage, 
        is a measure used to assess the socio-economic background of a school's student population. ICSEA scores are calculated 
        based on the level of education, employment, and income of student parents, offering useful insights into the diversity
        and socioeconomic status of students.</p>
